    # Greedy Algorithm usies the vertex distances and predecessors pointers 
    # it also pushes all vertices to a queue of unvisted verices and computes the shortest distance
    # and by utilizing recursive process to determine the best location to visit based on current location

    # The following algorith utilizes 3 parameter:
    # 1. Packages lists
    # 2. Trucks identification or truck number
    # 3. Current location of the truck

    # There are 2 loops being utilized in this algorithm
    # The first loop is to identify the shortest distance to the next location. The lower value will continously change until the minimum value is found
    # Second loop is where the lowerst value has been determined. Using conditional statements the value is then assorted to the appropriate truck.The current package is taken out of the list
    # and the current location moves to the next optimal location
    # determined from the first loop. Lastly, a recursive call is made
    # for the next location and shortened list. Recursive calls will
    # continually be made until the base case is called, which will
    # end the function and return the now empty list.
