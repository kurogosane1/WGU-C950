    # Next we shall be utilizing the 'Greedy approach' algorithm. 
    # Greedy Algorithm usies the vertex distances and predecessors pointers 
     # it also pushes all vertices to a queue of unvisted verices and computes the shortest distance
     # and by utilizing recursive process to determine the best location to visit based on current location

     # The following algorith utilizes 3 parameter:
     # 1. Packages lists
     # 2. Trucks identification or truck number
     # 3. Current location of the truck

     # There are 2 loops being utilized in this algorithm
     # The first loop is to identify the shortest distance to the next location. The lower value will continously change until the minimum value is found
     # Second loop is where the lowerst value has been determined. Using conditional statements the value is then assorted to the appropriate truck.The current package is taken out of the list
     # and the current location moves to the next optimal location
     # determined from the first loop. Lastly, a recursive call is made
     # for the next location and shortened list. Recursive calls will
     # continually be made until the base case is called, which will
     # end the function and return the now empty list. 
     # Base Case: Length of the list is False, or zero.
